# CodeAlpha_BasicChatbot
This project is developed as part of the CodeAlpha Python Programming Internship (Task 4). It is a simple rule-based chatbot that interacts with users based on predefined inputs and replies. The bot takes user messages like "hello", "how are you", and "bye", and responds accordingly using conditional logic.
